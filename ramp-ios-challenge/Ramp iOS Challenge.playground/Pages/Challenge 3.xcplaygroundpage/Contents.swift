/*
 Hello! Thank you for taking the time to complete our
 coding challenge. There are 3 challenges, each on a
 separate page. The clue derived from each page will
 provide instructions for the next challenge.

 When you are done, please rename this playground to
 "first-last Ramp Challenge.playground" and submit it to
 ios-submissions@ramp.com.

 We recommend turning "Editor > Show Rendered Markup"
 on for a classier experience.

 Good Luck!

 - The Ramp Mobile Team
